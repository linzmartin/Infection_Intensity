TO DO:

----------

COMPLETED: 
*fix CI estimates - include 7 for interaction instead of 9 for theta
*re-run to replace categorical output for AICs/loglik


* what number of zeros for each group (as in predict non-zero values) by category
*No zeros are predicted by model - 
Model does show whether or not an exisiting zero has a probability of being excess or predicted


Group predictions by temperature


separate effects of temp and age in interaction term??
make interaction plot

put new code in R markdown
rerun R markdown
Save all in Box

make lab meeting presentation

PRESENTATION

Problem and what's causing problem
zeros and non-signif

why include zeros

Question: we know it's infected, how is infection intensity impacted by T*A

find model to include zeros


approach:
- usu Poisson
- Neg bin doesn't help with zeros
- fit with zero-inflation - two component model


Model output
what it means

predictions + zero predictions

Summary figure for predictions vs. actual data
